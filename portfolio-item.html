            <p>A user can hire employees & process payroll.</p>
            <img src="img/screenshot3.png" alt="">
            <p>When the user decides they want to hire an employee, they will enter demographic information as well as answer yes/no to some questions regarding tax withholdings.  A pointer to Employee object is created & assigned to a dynamically allocated array of Employee pointers.  This array represents the employee listing.</p>
            <p>When the user decides they want to process payroll, a merge sort algorithm will sort the list of employees.  A pointer to Payroll object is created & assigned to a dynamically allocated array of Payroll pointers.  This array represents the payroll history.  The user can then traverse through the employee listing & decide who to pay.  When paying someone, a node is created in a doubly linked list, in which the value in the node is a pointer to Paycheck object.</p>

            <p>I designed each item as it's own class to mimick a real-world payroll software, including typical attributes found in each.  Classes are, Paycheck, Employee, Payroll, & Teacher.  Teacher class was used to apply polymorphism, however, will be utilized more when a future feature will be added.  The actual program including where user input & menu is housed, is in the payrollProgram class.  I decided to represent the actual checks being paid out in a Payroll as a doubly linked list.  When traversing through the employee listing to decide who gets paid, the pointer to the Employee is passed as an argument, in order to create a node.  This design allowed me to include only necessary methods for each class & also limit creating too many methods for another.  Using pointers also prevented the need to constantly have functions that return something.</p>

            <p>When the user quits the program, all dynamically allocated memory is deallocated for reuse.</p>
